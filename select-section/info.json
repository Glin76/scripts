  "description": "This script provides menu entries and icons meant <b>to select</b> (<b>or cut</b> to the clipboard) <b>the current section content</b>, header included.\n\nA <i>section</i> is all the content of a note between two headers of the same level. Mind that a section begins with its own header.\nThe <i>current</i> section is the section where the cursor is located at.\n\n<b>Why Selecting (or cutting) the current section?</b> What for? For instance, I use the script to quickly organize my note content (move sections). It is especially useful when the note content is used as a slide deck for tools such as <a href=\"https://marp.app/\">Marp</a>.\n\n<b>Beware</b>: this script only works with <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisalley/markdown-garden/blob/master/source/guides/headers/atx-headers.md\">ATX standard markdown headers (headers beginning with several “#” defining the level), not with <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisalley/markdown-garden/blob/master/source/guides/headers/setext-headers.md\">Setex headers (headers underlined with “=” or “-”)</a>."
