# Inbox script workflows

## Saving web pages

1. Open web page in browser;
2. Use "Reader view" to remove the clutter;
3. Save web page to inbox or anywhere inside note folder (if "scan folder" option is on);
4. Web page will be converted to markdown note

These Firefox extensions will make this workflow more efficient:  
[Save File to](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/save-file-to/) by Atte Kemppil√§ - adds new context menu items to quickly save web page to desired directory.  
[Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=search) with [Reader Mode Button Always Visible](https://userstyles.org/styles/123290/reader-mode-button-always-visible) userstyle - forces "Reader view" availability for every page or  
[Open in Reader View](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/reader-view/) by rNeomy - adds context menu items to use "Reader view" even on pages Firefox doesn't allow to.

## Photographed documents

1. Create sub-folder in inbox;
2. Put photos of document pages to that sub-folder;
3. All photos will be in one note named like sub-folder;
4. You can add more pages later.

[Easy Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easy4u.scanner) by Easy4u is quite good light photo scanner application for Android.

## Dropping attachments

Drop any important non-note file, like a .pdf, or .docx to inbox or anywhere inside note folder (if "scan folder" option is on) to have a note linking to that file in QOwnNotes. Attachments allow your notes to extend the limits of markdown when it's needed.

## Note-taking and bookmarking from Android

1. Make a folder on your Android device synced with inbox;
2. Open web page or anything you want to note - sms, message, text selection, QR code;
3. "Share" it with plain text editor like [Fast Notepad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taxaly.noteme.v2&hl=en), with its save folder synced with your inbox;
4. Add @topic to text to save it to "topic" note;
5. You can also share images and other files with file manager like [Total commander](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander) to drop them to folder synced with your inbox.
