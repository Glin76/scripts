  "description": "Inbox is a complex script to organize data added from different devices and applications.\n\n<b>It's currently at beta stage, so using it for unrecoverable data is discouraged.</b>\n\nThe script processes files in inbox folder you set or whole note folder (depending on settings) as follows:\n- The script turns all .txt files and files with no extension to .md notes with modification time in the file name.\n- If there's a word that starts with a '@' (configurable) in .txt file, content of that file will be added to .md note named like that word. The content of .txt file with '@topic' in text will be added to 'topic.md' file. Outside of inbox folder the text won't be added to note but will become a new standalone note.\n- Every URL in text file will be converted to markdown link, with web page favicon and title if possible.\n- Any web page, saved as .htm file with '_files' folder, will be converted to .md note.\n- Any image file placed to inbox folder will be moved to media folder. The script will put .md note with the in-line image instead.\n- Any other file placed to inbox folder will be moved to attachments folder. The script will put .md note with a link to the file instead. On Linux the file icon will be put before link.\n- (Inbox folder only) Text/link of file placed to sub-folder of inbox folder will be added to .md note named like the sub-folder. Everything put to 'topic' sub-folder will be added to 'topic.md' file. Topic words won't work in these sub-folders.\n- (Linux only) The script will put thumbnail for .pdf file as a link to it.\n- (Linux only) The script will replace large in-line image with a smaller one as a link to original.\n\n <a href=\"https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts/blob/master/inbox/workflow.md\">Workflow examples</a>\n\n<b>Dependencies:</b>\n<a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\">Python 3.3+ Interpreter</a>;\n(optional, continuous watch mode)<a href=\"http://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/installation.html\">Watchdog module</a>;\n(optional, web page to note)<a href=\"http://pandoc.org/installing.html\">Pandoc</a>;\n(optional, Linux only, pdf thumbnails) ghostscript;\n(optional, Linux only, image thumbnails) imagemagick;\n(optional, Linux only, file icons) python-gobject.\n\n<b>Usage:</b>\nRun the script by toolbar button or menu item.
